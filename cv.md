## About __me__

For many years I worked as a layout designer for various magazines and newspapers. In my opinion, in the modern world, paper media have long lost their relevance. They have been replaced by the Internet. In order to remain in demand as a specialist, it is necessary to acquire new knowledge, which I intend to receive by completing the front-end developer course at Rolling Scopes School.
